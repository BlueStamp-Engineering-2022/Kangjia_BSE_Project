# Second Milestone
My second milestone involved getting the base project fully functional and also getting an upgraded Raspberry Pi. I wrote all the code, tested it to ensure it was working, and added some minor functionality to help with debugging in the future. In the demo, I had not fully installed it into the case because the new raspberry pi still lacked mounting supports. However, the case was fully ready.

# First Milestone
My first milestone was setting up all the software on the Raspberry Pi and also building the outer case for the camera. I set up the Raspberry Pi Zero W with the Raspbian operating system (as usual), and finished writing all the code and installing the dependencies for the base project. For the outer case, I built it out of black acryllic panels and superglue. For the next week of my project, I plan to put all the components together and test my code. Afterwards, Iâ€™ll work out assembly into the case and also start project modifications.

# Starter Project
My starter project was a Simon Says game, a memory game where your goal is to remember and repeat a random sequence of colors gradually increasing in length by pressing the four buttons on the front. Through building the project, I learned the extremely useful skill of through-hole soldering. In fact, *every* component on the board required soldering, so I got a lot of hands-on practice. I was also really happy with the result once it was finally completed.
