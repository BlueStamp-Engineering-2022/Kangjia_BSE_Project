# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
My first milestone was setting up all the software on the Raspberry Pi and also building the outer case for the camera. I set up the Raspberry Pi Zero W with the Raspbian operating system (as usual), and finished writing all the code and installing the dependencies for the base project. For the outer case, I built it out of black acryllic panels and superglue. For the next week of my project, I plan to put all the components together and test my code. Afterwards, I’ll work out assembly into the case and also start project modifications.

# Starter Project
My starter project was a Simon Says game, a memory game where your goal is to remember and repeat a random sequence of colors gradually increasing in length by pressing the four buttons on the front. Through building the project, I learned the extremely useful skill of through-hole soldering. In fact, *every* component on the board required soldering, so I got a lot of hands-on practice. I was also really happy with the result once it was finally completed.
